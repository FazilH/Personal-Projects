## Background

Hello!

My name is Fazil Hussain and welcome to my Project Portfolio! A little bit about
me. I have been working with Cognizant Technology Solutions for the past 4 years
as a Sr. Process Executive, where My role is to curate the Sitelink extensions
that appear in ads at the top and bottom of Google search results. My current
job profile is non-technical which led me to upscale my skill and become more
industry relevant, for which I enrolled in a PG Program in Data Science. I
completed my Masters in Data Science in April 2021.

Now I focus on learning more and more about Data Science and Machine Learning
